## Software for making subtitle
Currently: 

* Aegisub
* Arctime Pro

I ignore these ugly software which built between 2000 and 2010 and support windows onlyï¼Œ  

## Downside of Aegisub
![](./img/aegisub.jpg)

* no update since 2014
* UI look olds, no night mode
* hotkey support is not good, it crash the software sometimes  


## Downside of Arctime Pro
![](./img/arctime.jpg)

* UI look OK, but not good enough
* the experiences on macOS just not good
* Subtitle block with same timeline would overlap, making bilingual subtitle is difficult

Pro:  
* Arctime have waveform in the background

## Product Roadmap
Overall Goal:
* Aegisub have way too many feature, So I am not gonna set my goal to replace Aegisub for now
* make adjust timeline for subtitle a great experiences

### Version 1.0
* beatuiful UI
* easy to change timeline
* Support one or two subtitle format for now (srt / ass)
* it's a MVP, try to as minimal as possible

### Version 1.5
* Hotkey

### Version 2.0
* Add machine translate feature (Google / IBM / Azure / Amazon)
* Add hard burn subtitle into video feature (make subtitle as part of the pixels)
